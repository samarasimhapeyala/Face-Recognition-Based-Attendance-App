# Face Recognition Based Attendance System
## Integrated with Web App using Flask
Due to COVID19 everyone raised “Switch off” Biometric Attendance motto. In view safety from spreading of viruses by using traditional
attendance systems. We developed this Face recognition based attendace system. Used OpenCV and CNN based architecture for face
recognition. Trained 155 images with shape of 224 224 of students and used flask to make web app and Jython for android app.
